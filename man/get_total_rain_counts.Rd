get_total_rain_counts(
  data_by_year = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_by_year}{A named list of summary definitions, typically returned by
\code{\link[=get_r_instat_definitions]{get_r_instat_definitions()}}, for the annual dataset.}

\item{annual_total_rain_col}{(Optional) Column name for total annual rainfall.}

\item{seasonal_total_rain_col}{(Optional) Column name for total seasonal rainfall.}

\item{annual_rainday_col}{(Optional) Column name for the annual rain-day count.}

\item{seasonal_rainday_col}{(Optional) Column name for the seasonal rain-day count.}

\item{definitions_in_raw}{(Optional) Raw metadata definitions (from unaggregated data),
used to extract the rain-day threshold.}

\item{rain_days_name}{(Optional) Name of the indicator in the raw metadata (e.g., \code{"count"})
used to define a rain-day threshold.}

\item{data_name}{The name of the main data frame.}

\item{rain_name}{The rain variable in the data frame.}
}
\value{
A list representation of annual rain definitions.

A named list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{annual_rain}{List of summary parameters for annual rainfall totals and rain-day counts.}
\item{seasonal_rain}{List of summary parameters for seasonal rainfall totals and rain-day counts.}
}
Each of these lists may include:
\itemize{
\item \code{total_rain} – indicator for total rainfall.
\item \code{n_rain} – indicator for number of rain days.
\item \code{rain_day} – rain-day threshold definition.
\item \code{na_rm}, \code{na_n}, \code{na_n_non}, \code{na_consec}, \code{na_prop} – metadata about missing-value handling.
}
If a definition cannot be found or is ambiguous, the corresponding values will be set to \code{NA}.
}
\description{
Retrieves annual rain definitions.

This function retrieves metadata definitions for total rainfall and the number of rainy days,
separately for annual and seasonal periods. It searches the supplied summary definitions for
rainfall-related indicators, using naming conventions and filter criteria to distinguish
annual from seasonal data. Optionally, it also extracts the rain-day threshold (e.g., \verb{>= 1 mm})
from raw metadata.
}
\details{
The function attempts to match rainfall indicators using the column names provided
(e.g., \code{"sum_rain"}, \code{"count_rain"}).
Heuristics are then applied to decide if a match refers to annual or seasonal data:
\itemize{
\item Definitions filtered by variables like \code{start_rain} and \code{end_} are considered seasonal.
\item Definitions without such filters are assumed to be annual.
}
If \code{definitions_in_raw} and \code{rain_days_name} are provided, the function calls
\code{\link[=get_rain_counts]{get_rain_counts()}} on the raw metadata to retrieve the rain-day threshold.
}
