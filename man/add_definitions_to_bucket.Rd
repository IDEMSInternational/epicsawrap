This function adds a new definitions file with a timestamp to a specified Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The new definitions are sourced from a JSON file provided as input.
}

The function creates a timestamp in the format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" and appends it to the station_id to form the filename. It then reads the provided JSON file, creates a new JSON file with the timestamped filename, and uploads it to the specified GCS bucket.
}
