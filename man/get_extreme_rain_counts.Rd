\title{Extract Extreme Rainfall Threshold Definition}
\usage{
get_extreme_rain_counts(
  definitions_in_raw = NULL,
  extreme_rainfall_column = "extreme_rain"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{definitions_in_raw}{A named list of raw definitions, typically obtained from
\code{get_r_instat_definitions()} on the unaggregated dataset.}

\item{extreme_rainfall_column}{The name of the rainfall definition to extract from.
Default is \code{"extreme_rain"}.}
}
\value{
A list with one element named \code{"extreme_rain"}, containing:
\describe{
\item{sign}{The extracted comparison operator (e.g., \code{>=}, \code{<}).}
\item{threshold}{The threshold value as a character string (e.g., \code{"40"}).}
}
If the definition is missing or malformed, both elements are returned as \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This is a convenience wrapper around \code{\link[=get_rain_counts]{get_rain_counts()}} specifically for extracting
the threshold and comparison operator used to define an "extreme rain day" condition,
such as \code{"(rainfall >= 40)"}. The result is returned as a list nested under the
\code{"extreme_rain"} key.
}
\examples{
defs <- list(extreme_rain = list(rain_day = list(NULL, "(rainfall >= 40)")))

# Returns: list(extreme_rain = list(sign = ">=", threshold = "40"))
get_extreme_rain_counts(defs)

}
